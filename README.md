# LessGrindyScience
Hey, Space Program Managers! Are you tired of science being too hard? Get Less Grindy Science today and receive 75% of the science cap at any one time!

This mod requires ModuleManager, as it's a simple MM config.

I made this mod because it is the opposite of my main mod and I want to cater to both kinds of people. The code is based on Grindy Science and is also MIT licensed.
